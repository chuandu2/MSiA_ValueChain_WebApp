## Project Charter 

**Vision**: To predict used car values for sellers and buyers.

**Mission**: Enable users to input features of the used cars they are interested in (car age, vehicle type, gear box, etc.) and generate the predicted value based on their entries.

**Success criteria**: Users can clearly understand the meanings of the features that need inputs, and successfully get predicted used car values within 10 seconds each time based on their entries. Optimize the predictive model for predicting the used car prices to achieve reasonably high cross-validation accuracy of price predictions.
